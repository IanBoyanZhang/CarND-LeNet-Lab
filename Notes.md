Pooling 
Non linear down sampling
2. [CNN Pooling layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#Pooling_layer)

The function of the pooling layer is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting. It is common to periodically insert a pooling layer in-between successive convolutional layers in a CNN architecture. The pooling operation provides a form of translation invariance.
